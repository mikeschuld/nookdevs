	<string name="how_to_play">It\'s you against a grid of squares.\n\nSome squares have a mine hidden under them; clicking on one loses the game.  Other squares are safe; clicking on one clears the square, revealing a clue: a number indicating how many of its neighbors are mined.\n\nYour job is to clear all the safe squares, and plant a warning flag on all the mined squares.\n\nTo flag a square, click on the flag icon on the right side of the touchscreen and then click on the square.  (Or, if you feel brave, you can just long-click on the square.)\n\nTo start a new game, click on the robot icon.\n\nGood luck!</string>
