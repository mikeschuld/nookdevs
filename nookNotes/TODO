ISSUES

IMMEDIATE

- make user confirm any transformations
- change long-press "Add item" to insert below the currently-selected item rather than at the very end of the list

FEATURES

- add a transformation for deleting all checked items
- make long-press on the main view's up/down buttons move to the previous/next page (and select the top-/bottom-most item there again)
- make long-tapping left/right on the soft keyboard go the the next/previous word, up/down to top/bottom
- add a transformation deleting all checked icons?

COSMETICS

- change pagination dots to be in style with B&N apps (fill only the current page; affects nookLibrary as well)
- disable menu and other buttons context-dependently?
- make the menu scrollbars look like the B&N ones

NIGGLES

- change "move" URI semantics to not encode the destination index in the URI itself but in the ContentValues
- work around emulator crashes with the soft keyboard
- get custom themes to work after all?!
