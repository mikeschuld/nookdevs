FEATURES

- make long-tapping left/right on the soft keyboard go the the next/previous word, up/down to top/bottom

COSMETICS

- change pagination dots to be in style with B&N apps (fill only the current page; affects nookLibrary as well)
- disable menu and other buttons context-dependently?
- make the menu scrollbars look like the B&N ones

NIGGLES

- change "move" URI semantics to not encode the destination index in the URI itself but in the ContentValues
- work around emulator crashes with the soft keyboard
- get custom themes to work after all?!
