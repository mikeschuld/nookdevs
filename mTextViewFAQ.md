0.0.1 initial version

# Introduction #

This is a plug-in to allow you to read text files on your nook.

# Dependencies #

You must be running the latest version of nookLibrary.

Your text files must end with a `.txt` filename extension.

# How to use #

You should not add mTextView to the launcher menu.

Just side-load text files onto your nook just like any other book.  When you open a text file from nookLibrary, nookLibrary will launch mTextView to view it.

# Limitations #

This is a basic viewer only.  There is no support for annotations, bookmarks, or dictionary look-ups.
