# Introduction #

An app for playing crossword puzzles on the nook.  Puzzles not included.

# Dependencies #

Please install the **fileSelector** package as well.  nookCrossWord depends on it.

# Supported Formats #

Currently, nookCrossWord can read Across Lite and XPF puzzle files.  (Across Lite is probably the most common format; these are files that end in the .puz extension.)

Puzzles with Rebus entries are not supported yet.

# Getting Puzzles #

Most puzzles are copyrighted, which is why this app does not ship with any.  But many can be downloaded free of charge for personal use.  For example:

To play on your nook, download the puzzle (usually ending in a .puz extension), and copy it into the "my crosswords" folder on your nook.  (This folder should be created for you automatically the first time you run the nookCrossWord app.) You can create sub folders under this one.
